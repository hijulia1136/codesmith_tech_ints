# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 2 Challenge
Problem: B ...atLeastOne
Timer: 55 mins

\*Declare variable
+read prompt aloud
+excellent technical communication
+console.log to confirm array declaration correctly
+correct

\*isOdd
+read prompt
+gave an overall strategy that was accurate
+pseudo code
+excellent technical communication
+creates own tests
+announced start of coding; use of modulo
+excellent technical communication
-didn't notice that he was getting a fasly answer
+well organized within pseudo code and code block
+correct results and provided explanation as to why it worked

\*atLeastOne
+read prompt aloud
+setup of initial function
+gave an overall strategy that was accurate with good logic
+technical communication indicates solid understanding of callback
+understood for loop and breaking out for correct results
+pseudo code in line with his previously stated strategy
+excellent technical communication
+excellent logic and understanding of the problem and how to apply his logic
+created tests beyond initial array
+utilized isOdd correctly as callback for tests
+announced start of coding; excellent technical communication of his for loop and explanation of logic for his intended solution
+well organized pseudo code and code block
+excellent technical communication for conditional statement that is invoking callback with solid understanding of purpose
+received two true results - unexpected and wants to review code
+console logs within function and element array i
+is reviewing isOdd and making changes
+receives correct results for atLeastOne but recognizes needs to go back to isOdd and adjust to fix falsy value
+was able to explain the solution and why it was working and what he had to do to fix isOdd

Level 2 Challenge
Problem C: countChars
Timer: 40 mins

+read prompt aloud
+overall strategy involves removing white space and return stringLength
+setup of initial function
+pseudo code
+wants to use replace method to remove whitespace??
-modifies original string with replace
+implements replace method correctly
+returns string length
+-does not get the right result after writing own test cases; is not deterred and now wants to use recursion
+talks through new strategy with recursion including base case and moving replace method within recursive call
+explains adjustment to pseudocode and code and revises pseudocode with new strategy
+checking mdn for string includes method to confirm syntax
+using bang operator to confirm if white space is found
+declares new variable using const correctly
+completes recursive call correctly and receives correct result
+starts next challenge but asks if he can go back and provide full explanation of why the solution works; does so with excellent technical communication to include why he had to correct his original strategy

Level 3 Challenge
Problem A: MemoryMaker
Timer: 33 mins

+read prompt aloud
+setup of initial function including tests
+provides overall strategy with technical communication and good logic
+announces pseudo code; does so with excellent technical communication and recognizes the need to be mindful of closure
+creates own tests with intended results and explanations demonstrating full understanding of the prompt and his intended solution ++ this is before he starts coding
+announces start coding with excellent technical communication
+receives correct results and provides explanation as to why

Level 3 Challenge
Problem B sumAllElements
Timer: 25 mins

+reads prompt
+states overall strategy and says his initial thoughts of using a loop wouldn't work and recognizes need to use recursion
+setup of initial function and test cases
+reviews initial strategy to confirm not using any methods and that his base case will work; accurate and with great technical communication; can clearly visualize the execution context of the function
+announces pseudocode; does so with excellent technical communication maintaining his original strategy
+created own tests including previously declared arrays for other problems
+also states he will create an edge case to confirm his logic for all scenarios
+announces start to coding; excellent technical communication throughout base case
+pauses and asks if array length is in fact a method; asks if he can look it up and confirms it is a property and says he is relieved that he can use it because it is a property and asks if this is a correct understanding; thanks me for answering questions and letting this course of his logic to proceed
+continues coding confidently with excellent technical communication and understanding of his intended conditional
+looks up slice method to confirm it is a method; then asks to confirm; I usher him to re-consider his logic and then to consider how we can iterate or move through an array; he correctly states using an index or i that would be incremented with each recursive call
+announces that he would like to adjust his pseudocode and his code; does so with excellent technical communication and re-states the strategy and why it should work for the test cases
+creates another test case to confirm correct functionality
+receives syntax error; corrects immediately
+Receives an infinite loop and recognizes he forgot to code out his base case but had it written in pseudo code; has a good laugh about it and fixes his code
+before testing again states his intended strategy and an explanation of how he coded it out and why it should work for the tests
+correct results received
+++he asks if his understanding of the prompt was correct to use recursion and that he should consider the prompt that says do not use methods, etc is really an ask to create a method under-the-hood; we chat about this and he is excited that he was correct

Level 4 Challenge
Problem A anagrams
Timer: 10 mins

+read prompt aloud
+thinks strategy is to use recursion; provides an excellent strategy behind using recursion
+setup of initial function and created test cases
+announces pseudocode with excellent technical explanation of his base case
+explains why his intent is to declare a variable to store results and when he will push results into it with his recursive call
+excellent understanding of his logic as he proceeds with pseudocode
+recognizes need to have a nested for loop to swap but isn't quite sure when it should occur and states he just wants to pseudocode that logic to visible see it all written down before confirming
+creates own tests cases beyond what's given
+announces start to coding; excellent technical communication throughout coding
+excellent code block organization with pseudocode to ensure he is maintaining his logic and intent

+friendly and polite even when he didn't get the correct results for isOdd; was never deterred and confidently moved to debug and revise
+very calm and maintained his communication at all times; his problem solving skills and ability to think through a challenge/solution are confident but reviews his logic to confirm his intent aligns to the strategy
+got very excited with his solution to sumAllElements and his understanding of the prompt and solution
