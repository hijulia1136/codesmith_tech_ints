# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 1 Challenge
Problem: A declare variable, addNumbers
timer: 55 mins

+read prompt aloud
+annoucned setup of function
+no pseudo code (see note below)
+code spoken directly
-no logic
+created own tests
+syntax error with = sign; but knew where error was
+correct result
+was able to explain solution

Level 2 challenge
Problem B: addOne, SubtractOne, potions
timer: 51 mins

+read prompts aloud
+acknowledged easier problems for addOne, subtractOne
+re-read prompt and gave logic
-no pseudo code (see notes)
Potions:
+re-read prompt and gave logic
+initial setup of function
-no logic given -- started coding
+decided to pseudo code logic to ensure he was understanding problem; good logic but struggled to get it down into pseudo code; solid explanation of conditional statements' logic
+re-read his logic and gave a high level strategy; thinks he might be missing something but wants to proceed to test it out
+technical communication while coding was excellent
+-paused in the middle of writing his for loop code; acknowledged he is having trouble thinking through logic of accessing previous element of string -- did not use pseudo code as guide; pseudo code was down below and was not consulted during coding for loop and conditional statements
+understood callback to previous functions addOne and subtractOne
+got through initial if, else if logic and was able to clearly state what he was checking
-deleted pseudo code
+reference error; knew where to look at fix it
+now received a string of a number instead of result
-paused and is reviewing his code in silence
+announced he wants to re-write his code to make sure they are more readable
-thinks the issue is the callbacks but didn't know where to go and asked for some help; advised/asked him what we can do in between lines of code to confirm what is happening --- console logs; he recognized it right away
-was getting stuck with the code just stopping at one element of the string; asked for help and I advised that he needed to consider how to make the outcome include more than one character; inserted a push but didn't realize that his result variable is a string not an array; he is not moving his string to an array; advised about the push method and he jumped ontop of me and said 'he wasn't making an array' but then he just changed his result variable to an array; then proceeded to look up join method without explaining logic; inserted join and toString chaining but not correctly or without technically communicating
+--asked if he could think for a moment; came back on and said he wants to re-try his solution and deleted his entire code (and previously deleted his pseudo code which had good logic)
-started new coding without strategy and without pseudo code
-using an object and result array variables
-no logic given no real technical communication just reading his written code verbatim
+----started pseudo coding logic within his for loop for the conditional statements and then stopped midway and started coding again -- use of object is confusing as it holds two key-values with booleans; conditional logic is to check if 'letters' exists within object then to push into result array
--no logic to follow and continues to pause while coding to confirm his logic
+use of 'in' operator within if statement
--this solution is very confusing and creates many nested if else if statements; is too bad because clearly he understands JS fundamentals
+created tests and received ref error; understood where to look
-recceived a type error with use of 'in' operator; knew where to look
-received an array of all the characters; did not go back and console log within the if statements but knew that the if statement is not operating correctly; asked to take a moment to think
--again no logic or clear approach presented
++returns and states that his logic is problematic and understands where he is going wrong verbally
--starts changing code and receives different problem within his result; pauses
--thinks he wants to use slice method; pauses
+asked for a nudge; advised him to re-read prompt and consult his logic within the for loop and conditional statements
-starts to re-read prompt and goes silent
-announces he is thinking of using slice method again but thinks it will be problematic later
-announces restart of conditional statements and deletes it all
+announces he is going to follow the logic of the problem +++starts pseudo coding with good logic (original logic)
+announces he is going to go step by step to write out conditional statements
--poor logic and understanding of what toLowerCase method will do while checking his string
--writes code directly speaking it as he proceeds
--announces he sees different logic and problem of what he is doing wrong
--long pause
--I asked if I could talk through his logic behind the object; he immediately recognized that it might be doing him more harm; we talked through his for loop and iterating
--long pause and threatened to delete all code; I stopped him and we walked through his logic entirely; I asked questions related to how we can access an element before i
++ good pair programming style to construct the initial if statement
--long pause and starts coding without communicating; he is receiving a syntax error but the rest of the code block is not properly constructed
++keeps positive attitude
-keeps coding in silence
--announces he needs more help;
++we worked through the problem, pair programming style
+time was up

+End of interview: he stated that he knew he didn't do great and asked what he should work through and I gave him some ideas and resources, and told him to not worry. I also advised he look into pair programming sessions to see how others follow their logic and maintain pseudo code.
+he asked for an overview of the program and I gave him a brief run down of the program from junior to senior portion
--explained that he doesn't like pseudo coding but rather to talk through each line of his code instead of writing out logic in advance

++overall: I think Jake knows his fundamentals and probably at the 9 or 10 level within our JS experience rating/benchmark, but he got stuck on a closure problem that just didn't make sense to him so I couldn't evaluate all his potential. My recommendation for him altogether would be to practice using his logic in psuedo code form with his coded solution, as his problem solving skills are likely as strong as his fundamentals. He needs more practice.
