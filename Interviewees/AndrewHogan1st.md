# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 1 Challenge
problem: addNumbers
Timer: 50 mins

+read prompt aloud
+gave high level strategy
+wrote pseudo code with explanation/rationale
+Technical communication of just code as he was coding
+wrote good tests and talked through them all
+got the correct answer

Level 2 Challenge
problem: between50and500
Timer: 45 mins

+read prompt aloud
+pseudo code OK - really just restating the problem; problem might be too easy for him
+stated his code as he was coding
+created own tests including edge cases
+asked if he could optimize code using 'ternery operator' -- did so correctly

Level 2 Challenge
problem: divBy100
Timer: 43 mins

+read prompt aloud
+asked how to pronounce modulo operator
+pseudo code strategy
+syntax error and immediately saw error and made fix
+correct answer

Level 2 Challenge
problem: negativeOrEven
Timer: 40 mins

+read prompt aloud
+asked how to pronounce modulo operator
+pseudo code strategy
-spoke of what he was coding but without rationale

- very quick coding
  +correct answer

Level 2 Challenge
problem: passAllTests
Timer: 38 mins

+read prompt aloud
+got quiet and then re-read prompt aloud remembering to communicate
+asked clarifying questions about creating tests
+gave his overall intrepretation and strategy
+excellent pseudo code
-spoke of code directly without rationale
+gave logic for conditional statement
+stated he was going to read over his solution before testing
+understood to comment back in previous functions and confirm those functions
+wrote good tests and an edge case
+correct answer

Level 2 Challenge
problem: palindrome
Timer: 33 mins

+read prompt aloud
+stated he was going to think aloud; thinking about how to split string; good verbal logic and understanding of the problem; wants to think through the fastest - thinks better to iterate than to split the string
+started pseudo coding logic to confirm and had light bulbs go off; excellent pseudo code logic and technical communication of rationale
+went to start for loop but asked if he could think aloud
+gave logic that he might be on the wrong path but wanted to keep going with present logic
+started for loop but recognized that what he had coded above probably wouldn't be necessary
+on the wrong path but wanted to look up how to round a number; looked up Math.floor
+correct implementation of Math.floor
+went back through each line of code and re-confirmed their intent with good logic
+spoke through second conditional accurately
+- announced he wanted to read over the entire problem; deleted parts of his code without explanation; caught a mistake but didn't explain;
+wrote own tests; wrong answer but found error and then got an infinite loop - recognized that his iteration was off; correct answer

Level 3 Challenge
problem: getLength
Timer: 23 mins

+read prompt aloud
+clarified if this problem could be solved with recursion
+announced he wanted to think through solution aloud - recognized he couldn't use pop so wanted to implement a counter
+wrote solid pseudo code with acknowledgement that he needed to look up methods to understand how to write code without using the method
+looked up mdn - string slice method
+I interjected and clarified his pseudo code logic and asked him to provide me with more understanding of what he wanted to do with his 'counter' and then light bulbs went off that he could track the length of the string as it relates to the counter
+completed his pseudo code
+started coding; used a default argument
+good base case with explanation
+wrote test cases; including empty string test case
+correct answer

Level 3 Challenge
problem: itemRetriever
Timer: 12 mins

+read prompt aloud; announced he wanted to re-read it
+read through examples
+asked if he could just talk aloud until he understood the prompt
+announced he wanted to setup initial function
+Pseudo code with counter logic to track element within the array
+paused and re-read the prompt to clarify logic
+recognized his logic was not quiet right but wanted to start coding and see what it looks like
+asked excellent clarifying question related to edge case of keys having different strings
+stated that he was going to clean up code but still wasn't certain what would happen within return
+clear code even without logic or pseudo code
+asked about edge case of counter exceeding length of array; deferred to him to make the right decision given the outcome he would receive
+++correct answer but went back to clarify with a conditional statement because he thought it was not clearly written; recognized how to get the function to re-start with the function logging the first element

Level 4 Challenge
problem: transpose
Timer: 7 mins

+read prompt; stated he didn't understand
+we clarified the example together; he asked clarifying questions that demonstrate great understanding
+stated his logic but immediately launched into setup of initial function
+stopped and pseudo coded; stated he just wanted to write down his immediate logic recognizing it would likely change
+announced he wanted to think about how to iterate - nested loops but doesn't like that efficiency
+great technical communication and verbal visualization while working through for loop logic; recognized necessity of nested loop
+stated he wasn't certain of the best way but wanted to brute force his way through it to see what would happen
+calmly coding while thinking aloud his logic of iterating through parent array
+announced he wanted to think through logic of his inner for loop;
+started coding inner looop but wasn't certain of logic and deleted conditional statement he had within his inner loop and wanted to iterate/loop within it
+slightly off in logic but he can see it
