# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 1 Challenge
Problem: addNumbers
Timer: 50 mins

+read prompt aloud
+gave an overall strategy that was on point
+stated that she was going to start pseudo coding and she did
+excellent pseudo code; good logic
+excellent explanation of what was happening inside the for loop
+excellent understanding of overall problem and her strategy
+announced she was going to start coding
+excellent technical communication throughout coding
+wrote test cases including edge cases
+excellent technical communication

Level 2 Challenge
Problem: addOne and subtractOne
timer: 45 mins

+read prompt aloud
+gave an overall strategy that was on point
+stated that she was going to start pseudo coding and she did
+excellent pseudo code; good logic
+announced she was going to start coding
+excellent technical communication throughout coding
+wrote test cases including edge cases
+excellent technical communication
+was able to do both functions correctly and then write tests for them
+excellent technical communication of her tests

Level 2 Challenge
Problem: usePotions
timer: 41 mins

+read prompt aloud
+clarified examples; stated her intrepretation of the problem
+stated overall strategy - split string into array and iterate array to check elements for letters and then take action with callback
+excellent technical communication
+announced she was going to pseudo code
+use of split method
+excellent pseudo code; easy to follow and to implement her strategy
+excellent technical communication throughout pseudo code
+excellent visualization and communication while explaining for loop and conditional statements strategy
+use of filter method in her strategy
+announced she was going to start coding
+excellent communication of not only her code but the rationale too
+understood difference between let and const - explaining why her declared variables were different and what the intended use would be later in the function
+excellent explanation of for loop with conditional statements - went beyond and said she wanted to confirm her logic aloud; she was correct but calming re-confirmed aloud
+explained use of filter method with rationale; accurate but wanted to look up syntax of filter method and did so via MDN to confirm her intended use
+use of arrow function - accurate and correct implementation
+completed function - communicated need to write test cases that were inclusive to the edge cases presented in the examples
+excellent technical communication of her test cases
+received wrong solution - in an array format; recognized issue - implemented join method; got semi-correct solution
+reocgnized that filter method was just off; announced how she was going to troubleshoot -- confirmed documentation for filter method; continued talking and decided to use console logging to follow her result before being passed into result
+was able to communicated problem as a result of her console log; knew to convert number before passing into filter method; used the Number method (!!! -- Wow!!! )
+tested again; but still got letters in her outcome
+continued talking through block;
+decided to eliminate use filter method and explained new strategy with use of replace method; looked up documentation related to replace method
+was able to explain entire code with new code and received the correct solution

Level 3 challenge
problem: getLength
timer: 23 mins

+read prompt
+recognized recursion; gave overall strategy
+announced start of pseudo code;
+started pseudo coding; paused when writing base case stated aloud that she wanted to confirm her base case by re-reading the prompt
+I had to interject to stop her from using the slice method; she told me she was going to re-read prompt and talk aloud but it wasn't necessarily going to be her solution; while talking aloud she thought of a for loop to iterate the string
+got excited with new solution
+I had to interject to not use length property - she was going to not use recursion and wanted to look up how to iterate through a string without methods -- I stopped this line of research afraid the answer would be presented. I put her back on track of recursion. She thanked me and said she would rework her strategy with my input.
+excellent communication within her pseudo code; all accurate with iteration of string
+at end of pseudo coding she said she wanted to restate her overall strategy to confirm her intend
+announced she was going to start coding
+use of default paramter
+excellent explanation of code and rationale
+wrote excellent tests that included good edge cases and communicated their intent
+received error but knew where it was and correctly made the change
+got correct answer

Level 3 Challenge
problem: itemRetriever
timer: 13 mins

+read prompt aloud and examples
+gave her interpretation of the problem
+stated she wanted to re-read prompt
+stated that she thought this was a closure with a counter and callback problem
+gave overall excellent strategy
+announced start of pseudo coding
+excellent technical communication of pseudo code with rationale; excellent visualization of what she intended to happen within function
+corrected herself on her counter initialization to be accurate to first element of array
+stated she needed to think how to properly access key-value pairs of object
+understood that the key would be the input string
+announced starting to code
+use of anyonmous function
+excellent explanation of code and rationale
+wrote tests that included and communicated their intent
+got correct answer
+seemed like a very easy problem for her

Level 4 challenge
problem: rotateGrid
timer: 7 mins

+read prompt aloud
+gave her interpretation of problem
+gave overall strategy that was perfect
+announced start of pseudo coding
+excellent technical communication of pseudo code with rationale, maintaining strategy
+paused to determine how to loop/iterate - decided to use forEach
+pseudo code and strategy includes temp variable with excellent logic and rationale
+reviewed her pseudo code and made edits to her intent
+announced she was going to start coding
+excellent rationale and technical communication throughout
+correct syntax with arrow function for forEach
+very unique solution -- wow!!!!
+was able to explain her tests
+received a circular reference; recognized her for loop/forEach might not be in the correct scope
+announced that she wanted to see result
+asked to just have a second to think; came back with good analysis of problem and her code; re-read prompt;
+recognized that she forgot to reverse the result;
+announced that she wanted to console log what was going on within both forEach instances to help her 'visualize what is going on'
+technically communicated the results she received from debugging
+recognized some confusion and renamed her second forEAch loop
+received syntax error and recognized it immediately
+new console log with each forEach; created distinguishable console logs
+announced that she thinks she should go back to her original solution
+looked up documentation on mdn array.From; technically communicated her understanding of documentation
+implementation was nearly there!

**She told me she was very nervous and we talked about how likely she was to suceeded and even if she didn't do very well today she would receive feedback to help her study and level up for a future interview. She was very appreciative of me calming her nerves.
**She is very gifted at solving algorithms. Very kind and willing to listen; would be easy to not only implement her code but to PP with and to learn from.
\*\*She asked a few questions related to the program, timelines and what she would get as feedback to understand how to improve.
