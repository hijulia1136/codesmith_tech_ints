# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 3 Challenge
Problem B countChar
Timer: 55 mins

+I drove
+read prompt aloud
+setup inputs, outputs and test cases
+talked through a strategy
+pseudo code with excellent technical communication
+coded with good clarity his intent and an explanation of each line as it relates to strategy
+created edge cases
+correct result but not optimize nor recursive so we went back and refactored
+he understood the approach I offered using recursion and he pseudo coded it out and then coded it out with technical communication and good logic
+then we talked through why this approach was more optimized as it relates to the call stack

Level 3 Challenge
Problem B sumAllElements
timer: 35 mins

\*\*I pulled another recurisve problem to evaluate his understanding given the previous problem
+He navigated and read the prompt aloud
+he gave a solid strategy
+we started pseudo coding with inputs, outputs and base case all presenting with sound logic and good technical communication
+He asked if he could pause and just think through aloud what his logic was to confirm it was headed in the right direction
+I had to clarify something within his two base cases and he recognized that his strategy might be off as a result but still asked if we could proceed because he wasn't seeing the issue fully yet
+he asked my opinion of the strategy and logic before starting to code
+We started coding with his instruction that was friendly, patient and calm
+He derived a few test and edge cases and we returned the correct reesults

Level 3 challenge
Problem: passwordSafe
timer: 15 mins

+I navigated
+After I read the prompt I asked what he thought and he stated that it sounded like a closure problem to him
+we talked through a high level strategy and we clarified the terms we should use for our variables so we didn't get confused
+we started pseudo coding and he asked questions about the logic I was laying and they were intellgient and demonstrated a good understanding of how the function would execute
+we started coding and he asked if he could write the functional in the traditional format so he could see how the inner function was really running
+We exchanged technical communication and used the examples as our tests
+Once we received the correct results for the examples he asked if we could make up our own test; we talked through it and he did so, offering an explanation about the callstack and execution context

Level 4 challenge
problem: subsetSum
timer: 5 mins -- went over time after hearing his initial approach

+I navigated; he drove
+He read the prompt aloud
+He identified the problem as one of permutations and asked about using two-pointers to solve it; which I thought might work and we should give it a try asking him to explain his logic as we pseudo coded
+while pseudo coding he had a clear understanding of how he wanted to iterate the array but his approach was to create extra variables to hold the results of adding each element of the array to the next individually, and then to increase the elements being added together by 2, 3, 4, etc. until we had variables that could hold all the potential possible sums across the array. I stopped him during pseudo coding to ensure 1) I was understanding his logic and 2) that he was considering all the examples given. He then re-read the examples and noticed that for the second test case his solution would take too long.
+He asked how this could be better solved. He had wanted to use the slice method earlier and I asked him to contemplate how we could use that while also doing tailcall recursion. He then asked if the target could change!
--+Time was up at this point, which I told him but asked if he wanted to continue trying to solve the problem with me. He agreed that he wanted to learn how to solve this problem.
+++He understood what to do at that moment and gave a good technical strategy
+we started re-pseudo coding the problem but he got lost in his logic of how the base cases would function to still meet the requirements of the second test case given.
+I navigated the pseudo code for the solution explaining each step and he took additional notes for his own learning.
+he made a comment that he wished he could visualize the callstack for this solution. I shared a number of visualization websites with him and we talked through the solution for the previous recursion problem so he could see how these visualization tools could help him with subsetSum. He thanked me profusly!

+Kind, soft spoken and cautious but has excellent fundamentals and solid technical communication. Easy to pair program with and feel collaborative energy. I think he gets nervous and second-guesses himself and just needs a confidence boost. He is ready for the program but an extra PP session will only increase his confidence. I explained as we wrapping up that the entire program is either completing units in pairs or working on group projects and the more he can get comfortable PP-ing the better adjusted he will be. He said he had two more PP sessions this week and planned to have at least three next week.
+We talked through what he can expect in the program and how else he should prepare for his next interview and the program. I guided him toward algos that cause blocks and stretch his analytical skills. I encouraged him to go into his PP sessions at a higher level than before, asking the partner to help him improve especially when he faces blocks, and to maintain his technical communication at all times.
