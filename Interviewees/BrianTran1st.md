# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 1 Challenge
problem: Add numbers
timer: 50 mins

+read prompt aloud
+gave high level strategy; thinks he can solve recursively
+pseudo code input and outputs
+confirmed prompted
+generated initial setup of function
+kept talking all the way
+explained both base and recursive case
+generated edge cases for testing
+excellent pseudo code that included high level strategy/logic for overall problem
+announced when he was going to begin coding
+received an error; saw the mistake; spoke through it all
+got the correct answer

level 2 challenge
problem: 50and500
timer: 45 mins

+read prompt aloud
+started by created console logs and initial setup of function
+created tests
+excellent technical communication during pseudo code;
+pseudo code before coding included input, outputs and expected outcome
+gave high level strategy before coding
+needed to take a break to put dog outside to avoid distraction; apologized for stopping <1 mins stop>
+technical communication throughout coding
+correct answer

level 2 challenge
problem: divBy100
timer: 42 mins

+read prompt aloud
+gave own intereptation of problem
+gave high level strategy
+started by created console logs and initial setup of function
+pseudo code before coding included input, outputs and expected outcome
+spoke about solving in one line using % operator; with excellent logic behind proposed solution
+correct answer

level 2 challenge
problem: passAlltests
timer: 40 mins

+read prompt aloud
+started by created console logs and initial setup of function
+new to uncomment out previous functions on his own
+excellent communication
+setup of function was excellent
+re-read prompt and confirmed initial strategy
+setup more test cases including edge cases
+re-read prompt used 'callbacks' when re-iterating his understanding
+commented out expected outcomes for his test cases
+general strategy and inputs and outputs pseudo coded
+hard parts setup of execution context and pseudo code
+paused pseudo code but kept talking, coming up with looping through array by passing in each value
+correct strategy and logic re-iterate aloud for himself
+revised pseudo code for entire problem ensuring his revision was accurate to his pseudo code
+continue speaking while coding
+used 'high order function' forEach; excellent technical communication
+used 'conditional statement'
+++got unexpected results; decided to see if hitting if statement, recognizing that the statement should be true; saw his error and said it aloud; recognized that forEach creates own execution context that returns different answer; decided to change to traditional for loop
++restated purpose of for loop and re-explained strategy
+got correct answer

level 3 challenge
problem: getLength
timer: 31 mins

+read prompt aloud
+created own console log to start working through strategy
+stated that he should solve recursively
+created test cases including edge cases of an empty string
+constructed setup in pseudo code with inputs, outputs; setup initial function and return value
+pseudo code of base case
+commented that he needed to just unpack his thoughts -- leading him to come up with base case with a count variable
+continued to talk through coding
+correct answer

level 3 challenge
problem: itemRetriever
timer: 25 mins

+read prompt aloud
+re-read prompt
+create console logs
+recognized closure; state good strategy to the problem
+constructed setup in pseudo code with inputs, outputs; setup initial function and return value
+excellent communication; excellent terminology knowledge
+re-stated general strategy
+used 'persistent memory' and 'execution content'
+took time to really develop and secure pseudo code confirming his logic
+announced his was going to start coding
+spoke through entire cocding, referencing pseudo code
+explained use of 'let' variable for re-use
+understood bracket vs dot notation
+received an error; but recognized error

level 4 challenge
problem: transpose
timer: 18 mins

+read prompt
+restated prompt
+setup test cases based upon examples; stated he was going to reorganize the example so he had a 'cleaner' view of the desire result
+constructed setup in pseudo code with inputs, outputs; setup initial function and return value
+excellent communication; excellent terminology knowledge
+re-stated general strategy
+recognized use of nested for loop
+gave excellent re-assessment of how he wanted to solve problem
+excellent pseudo code; clear and easy to follow
+stated that he needed to think through the 2d quality; gave an accurate assessment of columns vs rows of the 2d
+took his time to write accurate pseudo code recoginizing his error of switch column and rows; acknowledged he might need to see result
+was able to state through logic of each array loop and when results were pushed onto new output array
+fantastic pseudo code! acknowledged he felt good about it and hoped it made sense
+announced starting to code
+used 'const' to declare variable with correct rationale
+excellent variable names; clean code
+used 'let' declaration correctly
+used 'method of push'
+paused to confirm his logic of the inner for loop but continued talking with his thought process
+explained what he was correcting and why (flipped row and column again)
+decided to console log subarray to confirm what was happening within each loop
+got the wrong answer but was expecting it; wanted to see the dimensions; flips row and column and got half correct answer
+recognized his conditional was wrong; and explained what was wrong and fixed it correctly
+recognized it was a messy solve and offered to explain the problem over again - did so accurately

level 4 challenge
problem: balancedBrackets
timer: 7 mins

+read prompt aloud
+created console logs from example
+walked through all desired tests and confirmed understanding the expected outcomes
+constructed setup in pseudo code with inputs, outputs; setup initial function and return value
+excellent communication; excellent terminology knowledge
+re-stated general strategy
+got stuck with understanding of problem; told me he was just going to talk through it and see what would stick; came up with getting rid of all letters strategy
+walked through each expected outcome to see how he would come up with the logic
+told me he was going to continue thinking aloud; thinking of array or string to hold brackets
+told me he was going to say his thoughts for the logic but not pseudo code yet, wanted to make sure he had his strategy
+thought of maybe pushing bracket onto an array; 'i need to come up with a strategy to determine if they are balanced' but doesn't think this way is good.
+thought he might be able to solve recursively; referenced palindrome problem and using that strategy
+thought of replace method on a string- would need documentation on that

++would prefer whichever immersive program is first in August

+++was very kind when I had a coughing fit and needed to pause for one moment
+friendly and polite throughout
