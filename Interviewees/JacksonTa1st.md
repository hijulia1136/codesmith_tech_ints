# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 1 Challenge
Problem A ...addNumbers
Timer: 55 mins

+knew difference between let and const
+read prompt aloud
+created test; correct result

addNumbers
+read prompt aloud
+gave overall strategy with well thought out logic
+excellent technical communication
+announced start of pseudo code with inputs and outputs; excellent technical communication
+announced start of coding; well organized within pseudo code
+uses while loop and gives explanation but wants to ensure his syntax is correct; uses mdn
+excellent technical communication for his while loop and the conditional logic
+created own tests but also confirmed he should be using the example given or if that was frowned upon
+syntax error - spelling; found immediately
+gave excellent explanation why solution works

Level 2 Challenge
Problem A: ...passAllTests
Timer: 45 mins

between50And500
+read prompt aloud
+gave an overall strategy that demonstrated good understanding
+announced pseudo code with excellent technical communication and explanation for logic of conditional statement; inputs, outputs, function setup
+announced start of coding; well organized within pseudo code; excellent technical communication of how he wants to implement conditional statement
+Excellent syntax, ensuring brackets and semicolons for each line needed
+created own tests and edge cases
+syntax error - unexpected identifier; reviewed each line but has written (if (num IS > 50...)) -- he laughed when he found the error and joked that his technical communication is a bit too literal when writing code too
+received correct results

divBy100
+read prompt aloud
+gave good strategy; wants to use modulous operator with clear understanding of purpose
+announced pseudo coding; excellent technical communication; inputs, outputs, function setup
+announced start of coding; well organized within pseudo code; excellent technical communication of how he wants to implement conditional statement
+created own tests; gave an explanation with each as to why and what their expected outcome should be
+confirmed he didn't make previous syntax error
+received correct results and gave an explanation of his solution

negativeOrEven
+read prompt aloud
+gave good strategy with solid logic for his conditional statements and understanding div by 2 to determine even using modulo operator
++announced pseudo coding; excellent technical communication; inputs, outputs, function setup
+reconfirms his logic in his psuedo code
+announced start of coding; well organized within pseudo code; excellent technical communication of how he wants to implement conditional statement
+OR operator correctly used
+created own tests and edge cases; gave an explanation with each as to why and what their expected outcome should be
+received correct results and gave an explanation of his solution

passAllTests
+read prompt aloud; confirmed understanding of each statement
+recognized callback and correctly understood ask of prompt to pass in value to all functions in array
+recognizes he needs to put previous functions need to be put into an array to use in function
+states he needs to loop through array in order to pass value to each array
+gives high level strategy using excellent tech communication
+announces pseudo code; excellent technical communication; inputs, outputs, function setup
+wants to use a for loop to keep the logic clean and reserve console logging to ensure he is passing everything correctly
+fantastic understanding of his conditional statement check
+announced start of coding; well organized within pseudo code; excellent technical communication; pastes functions into array to ensure he doesn't have a typo;
+excellent communication for his for loop understanding what it is doing with each iteration
+clearly communicated his conditional statement reviewing his previous code to ensure all the logic was connected
+created own tests; gave an explanation for what he believes he results should be
-receiving false for all tests because -+has not used i within his conditional statement; recognizes that he code is skipping his for loop; wants to confirm syntax asks to look up on mdn; confirms his sytnax; wants to review his code to his psuedo code; found the issue! Gets all excited and is happy to have found the error. He asks to think aloud and gives sound logic but is only calling first function not the function at i; says he has never had to call a function within a loop index but codes calling only the first elemenet of array; is talking through his logic of his if statement; changes his boolean statements instead of focusing on his use of i; he finally found it and is so excited and is laughing at himself again;
+created additional tests; was able to give perfect explanation of why his solution works

Level 2 Challenge
Problem C: pallindrome
Timer: 10 mins

+read prompt
+is trying to recall a problem he just worked on where he had to access character of string;
+explains what he wants to do with excellent technical communication as a high level strategy
+wants to create a comparison so he is going to create an empty string variable to access character at each index
+announces pseudo code; excellent technical communication; inputs, outputs, function setup; wants to be careful with naming convention for his string variables
-declares his for loop to reverse in peusdo code but his code doesn't match as i is initialized to 0
+found his syntax error in his for loop
+excellent technical communication of his conditional statement
+created own tests; gave an excellent explanation for the result of each test
+syntax error found and corrected;
+received false for all results; console logs his second string variable; solution is to subtract 1 and then subtract i, effectively starting at the end of the first string; -- explains why with excellent technical communication

Level 3 Challenge
Probelm A: getLength
Timer: 4 mins

+read prompt; recognizes this prompt and believes he needs to use recursion
+he isn't sure how to approach the problem but hopes his pseudo code will help guide him to a strategy
+announces pseudo code; excellent technical communication; inputs, outputs, base case, recursive call, function setup;
+is thinking through base case provides excellent logic and incorporates logic into his base case with solid technical communication
+explains his recursive call with excellent technical communication
+announces start to coding
+-uses default parameter but no explanation as to why
-is having trouble visualizing how to stop or get his base case to occur; wants to create a test to ensure he is getting correct results for his if statement;
+pauses and says he wants to review previous solution to confirm he is navigating the string correclty;
+announces he is going to restart coding with his recursive call
+returns to his if statement and gives excellent technical communication as to his intended logic and how the recursive call with stop at this base case
+creates own tests and edge cases
+receives correct results and is relieved and pleased; gives an excellent explanation of why his solution works

+extremely friendly and polite; Good energy throughout; maintained communication at all times and was very considerate and calm; able to laugh at his silly mistakes
