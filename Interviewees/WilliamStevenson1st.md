# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 1 Challenge
problem: addNumbers
timer: 50 mins

+read prompt aloud
+pseudo code
+good technical communication through pseudo code
+good technical communication upon starting to code
+asked to think for a second; silently
+thinks he can solve problem recursively; pauses -- wants to look for a base case;
+continued technical communication while pseudo coding his recursive potential solution
-speaks code directly no rationale given
+-thinks he can solve recursively but no rationale given
+understands tail call recursion and gave rationale
+asked about creating own test cases
+spotted syntax error and fixed immediately
+tested and received NaN
+wants to console log as the code executes to see execution
+not getting expected results but wants to keep thinking; pauses and then pivots to editing code again
+edits code but expects to get inifinte loop which was right
+continues to get NaN
+finds his missing return and receives correct answer

Level 2 Challenge
problem: between50and500
timer: 39 mins

+read prompt aloud
+good pseudo code
+initial setup of function
+gave a high level strategy: problem wants me to use conditionals
+announced plan for coding then started
+good technical communication while coding but lacks rationale
+created tests for in between less and more than in order to log true and false
+received correct answer

Level 2 Challenge
problem: divBy100
timer: 34 mins

+read prompt aloud
+good pseudo code
+initial setup of function
+strategy is to use conditionals; modulus use with rationale
+good technical communication while coding
+created own tests to get each result
+correct result

Level 2 Challenge
problem: negativeOrEven
timer: 30 mins

+read prompt aloud
+good pseudo code
+good technical communication
+wants to use another conditional for his strategy with rationale
+modulus operator use
+initial setup of function
+announced he would use an OR statement
+created own tests to get various results
+found mistake with his operator of greater than instead of less than
+correct results

Level 2 Challenge
problem: passAllTests
timer: 24 mins

+read prompt aloud
+good pseudo code
+good technical communication
+wants to use conditionals
+thinks there's a method that checks for boolean value; looks up 'every' method via MDN but discovers it won't work because it requires a different array element type
+talks through strategy to use conditionals; thinks he wants to iterate through array of functions with good rationale behind why
+reviews pseudo code to confirm logic
+initial setup of function
+announces for loop with rationale
+provides logic behind passing each element into the array of functions
+thinks he might want to change logic but is going to continue with a note to review pending the outcome
+confirmed he should comment back in previous functions; thanked me for help bringing them back in
-is trying to build an array with invoked functions but announces he isn't certain
-appears to lack understanding how to invoke a function; has not mentioned callbacks
-has not properly called the function with the callbacks
+is correct with problem but not using correct technical communication
-pivots logic to erase passing in value into all and wants to create another function
-I stopped him after 3 mins and had him go back to his pseudo code and original logic; he found the error once we started talking through his intent within the loop; then we talked through how he was
-syntax for passing the value into each function is wrong receiving type error
+pivoted to creating another array that stores result of passing in values to arrayofFuncs
-hard to read code due to spacing
+arr[i] is not a function - wants to console to see what's going on; found mistake
+received false for every function; announced that his for push of the value received was wrong
+changed his invocation of the arrFuncs
+created own tests and it passed his rationale to test if the for loop and passing in the values was working correctly
+is returning an array of all the values received -- was his strategy to confirm he had the for loop correct and was calling the function correctly
+wrote a conditional statement psuedo code to determine if each value in array of booleans was true or false
+thinking aloud - wondering how to refer to every single element in array
++-finally recognized that if it finds one false doesn't need to iterate --- was not recognized as part of optimized solution
+excellent technical communication
+got only one boolean value to return correctly
+received correct results for his tests

feedback:
-could use some syntax practice; no semicolons or spaces in part of his code "number>=0" and "for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){}"
-include your rationale while coding for instance: 'we need to use a conditional to confirm XXX is YYY or not in order to pass that element into the result array'

+might have a sight impairment -- logged in as 'blind perdition'
+bit awkward - didn't know where he lived?? --- I think he was very nervous at first; warmed up as we moved along
+explained a bit about myself and he asked some polite general questions
+told me he was very nervous and we talked about how Codesmith wants him to succeed and how the interview process works overall with three rounds of feedback
+clarified his name preference: use middle name: Mason
+was very polite and appreciate my assistance
