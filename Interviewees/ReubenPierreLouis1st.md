# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 1 Challenge
Problem: A
Timer: 55 mins

\*\*declare variable
+prompt read aloud
+technical communication excellent; understood difference between let and var
+good pseudo code including console log
+technical commmunication upon coding;
+created own tests

\*\*addNumbers
+read prompt aloud
+-thinks overall strategy will involve recursion; not optimized
+gave own interpretation with rationale; careful to avoid inifinite loop
+excellent pseudo code; base case
+excellent technical communication throughout pseudo code
+initial setup of function
+technical comm while coding was excellent
-syntax a bit off
+created own tests
+found error - caps letter mistake
+was able to explain passing in initially declared variable in first prompt
+excellent technical communication
+correct results
+gave rationale behind solution

Level 2 Challenge
Problem: A
Timer:44 mins

\*\*between50And500
+read prompt aloud
+gave an excellent high level strategy
+knew immediately he wanted to use && operator
+announced he was going to start pseudo coding
+pseudo code included tests and expected results
+recognized a longer way to obtain result; doesn't think using a for loop is necessary; good analytical thinking
+recognized that he needs to pay attention so as not to make typos; made sure to copy/paste function name to avoid typo errors
+excellent technical communication while pseudo coding
+announced coding; excellent technical communication
+thought process aloud confirming his logic while coding
+understood tests given and gave rationale for edge cases
++gave rationale behind solution (thought it was easy and says anticipation of harder problems was making him nervous)

\*\*divBy100
+read prompt aloud
+thinks aloud about high level strategy; believes he understands
+recognized need to use modulo operator
+excellent high level strategy and technical communication
+psuedo code
+technical communication with pseudo excellent and with good logic
+acknowledges he might need to check syntax of modulo to make sure he is right but wants to try it
+talks through what he could do as other possible solutions -- excellent!!!
+announced coding; initial setup of function
+console logged initial statement with modulo
-poor spacing in statement 'return num%100===0
+created own tests;
+understood modulator does not have remainder
+correct results and gave rationale behind why solution works

\*\*negOrEven
+read prompt aloud
+focuses on 'or' statement in prompt and recognizes it is similar to a previous problem; wants to use || operator
+high level strategy with excellent technical communication
+announced pseudo code; excellent technical communication
+initial function setup
+wants to review his pseudo code to ensure it is clear for 'whoever is reading this'
+wants to be careful about typos; pastes function name
+excellent technical communication
+created own tests
+gave rationale for test cases with expected results
+correct results and gave rationale/summary behind why solution works
+understood that JS automatically will return false or -1 so does not need to write a false conditional check statement

\*\*passAllTests
+asked to read prompt to himself first due to length of prompt
+read prompt aloud
+asked me to confirm that he did create all previous functions
+gave overall excellent strategy; using for loop within those functions to confirm true but if it is every false it will return
+wants to complete initial setup -- brings previous functions back into global
+pseudo code is excellent
+technically communicated through for loop for each iteration within pseudo code
+review his pseudo code and made improvements to variable names for ease of understanding
+aloud: debated to use for loop or for each
--worried about time; has own timer on; wants to get through more problems
+technical communication while coding
+stops and says he needs to update pseudo code
-struggling to write a negative if statement with bang operator; wrong syntax;
+syntax error - confirms checking previous functions; found comment error
+stopped to review pseudo code
+struggled to properly
+thinks he might have resolved issues but wants to create a 'test kit'
+re-reads prompt for tests; pastes in previous function names - careful of typos; properly formatted in an array with value to pass in
+recognized that he has to include 'passAllTests' in to his console log - good rationle
-did not invoke passAllTests
+-found error; got results but they aren't correct
-working through error with bang operator -- recognized that is where problem lies
-makes an exhausted 'argh' noise; comments aloud 'what am I doing'
+reverses conditional but with no rationale
-+asks for help; encouraged to confirm use of bang operator; did not tell me what resource originally then remembered he needs to keep communicating and gave me understanding of what he was searching; used stack overflow
+found a good article re: falsy values and bang operator
+trying to work through block with bang operator
+wants to solve problem wants to pivot to another method to solve
+-changes code to if statements but no rationale or logic given
-goes quiet while trying to resolve; mumbling to himself can't understand
+acknowledged that he was off with bang operator and asked for help; we paired together with good communication and active listening
+received correct result

Level 2 Challenge
Problem: C
Timer: 7 mins

+read prompt aloud
+gave a good high level strategy
+wants to look up mdn split method before he starts pseudo code
+provides his intrepretation of what split method - like elements in array
+wants to then use reverse method
+announced pseudo code; excellent technical communication
-says aloud that he is running out of time -- asks how much; I tell him to keep going (we were at 45 seconds) since we paired during last challenge
-says he wants to go faster so he can get farther
+wants to use join but isn't sure he needs it; sticks with original logic
+uses method chaining correctly
+runs code to confirm no errors
+creates tests - incorrect and inserts joins because he needs to put it back together
+correct answer; gives rationale for overall solution

-abprupt; eating while talking to me and during interview
-asked how many questions he has to get through in order to pass; I offered explanation
-upon setup had to change chrome settings and just exited
-did not turn off notifications
-not cordial during interview; frustrated with blocks; wants to move faster to get more solutions
-seems competitive - perhaps just do to interview
-wanted to know if he 'passed'

++note to admin: might want to clarify 'pass' in a non-competitive explanation and the culture aspects of Codesmith NOT being a competitive bootcamp; during blocks seemed to become more negatively vocal
