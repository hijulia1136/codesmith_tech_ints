# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 1 Challenge
Problem: randomString
timer: 50 mins
// Decare a variable 'randomString' and set it to the string 'Hello World'

+read prompt aloud
+correct answer

Level 1 Challenge
Problem: isVowel
timer: 48 mins
/_
Create a function 'isVowel' that takes in a string (this string will be a single character) as an argument. "isVowel" should return true if the string is a vowel false if it is not. This function should consider letters a, e, i, o, and u to be vowels.
_/

+read prompt aloud
+asked assumption questions
-did not provide strategy or logic in advance to coding
+re-read prompt
+setup initial function
+recognized conditional statement needed
+thinking aloud; asked to look at notes for multiple variables
-long pause in silence
+re-read prompt to ensure understanding
+excellent questions to clarify; recognized his misinterpretation
+excellent syntax while creating all else if statements checking vowels
+created test case
-quiet ran and received error
-syntax error - but found
+checked devDocs to ensure proper syntax for else if; found error
-did not proper call test case error
+-needed my prompt to understand why his argument was not recognized /error; got the answer before I could finish explanation and was able to explain what was going on

Level 1 challenge
Problem: firstVowel
timer: 32 mins

+read prompt aloud
+gave high level strategy and understood use of first variable
+stated what he was going to do then did it in code
+re-read prompt; stated his intrepretation
+asked to pause to think to himself
+wants to use 'or statement' confirmed syntax before starting
-did not give strategy jumped right into coding
+was able to explain why and what his for loop was going to do
-silent coding
+-received error - re-read code; discovered syntax error; took time to do so but go there; tried to find sytax error in silience; required prompt to solve syntax issue
+received another error - unexpected end of input; discovered error on own but in silience
+created test case but wrong syntax to call function; corrected
+found other syntax error within for loop
-got a character not actual index but reviewed and understood what problem was - said so but didn't say what solution should be
-trying a number of things without explaining rationale
+-requried a prompt to ensure his conditional was accurately written; recognized problem but did not see how to correct it; looked at notes but did not tell me
+-required prompt to ensure for loop condition is correctly written
+re-read prompt
+-required prompt to evaluate conditional statement as written; I asked him to pseudo code out intent of conditional; he did so perfectly but did not know immediately how to edit code...he kept his thought process going aloud and I jumped to in to tell him he was correct in what he thought needed to be changed
+recognized needing to invoke the function
+- had to step and guide him as to what his pseudo code was directing him to do
+received proper answer

Level 2 Challenge
Problem: countTimes
timer: 40 mins

+read prompt aloud
+started with inital setup
-pause and said he needed to refocus
+starting coding; stopped to pseudo code recognizing he needed to slow down
+excellent logic in pseudo code to derive solution
-reviewed documentation (physical) without letting me know; nervous

\*\*\*noticed environment might not be setup conducively +confirm environment is helpful for his workflow

-try not to move so fast; ensure you have a plan and stick with it; your verbal plan often was different than what you executed
--keep talking even your inner thought process
--take your time; don't worry about 'screwing up' go forward and give logic and high level strategy write pseudo code and then start coding; if your solution doesn't work right away that's ok. You know your fundamentals but you need to work through logic to become more fluid. Pseudo code to keep you on track with your logic and commit to it before adjusting your code; your logic is good initially but you don't stick with it; seeing your logic in written form will help you effectively solve algos.
--focus on closure and recursion to ensure understanding of scope

+good fundamental knowledge; good technical communication and demonstration of terms
+follows a calm pace to problem solving, making it easy (when you are communicating) to follow along and understand logic.

- +Chris is a great person but needs a bit more confidence and practice. STRONGLY recommend JS hard parts and pair programming sessions with emphasis on closure and recursion and talking through logic. STRONGLY recommend he volunteer during JSHP classess to gain confidence in technical communication. Recommend start with level 3 with closure and callback.
