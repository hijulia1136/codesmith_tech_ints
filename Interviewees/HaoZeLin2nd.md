# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 4: Challenge C
Problem: Debounce
timer: 55 mins - end at 23 mins

+I was the navigator and after reading prompt and going over any clarifying questions we collaborated on a strategy. I explained a bit more about the event loop and duration based events, which he was exicted to learn about. We visited some MDN docs to clarify use of Date method and I ensured he understood its construction. He asked intelligent questions related to it and he even grasped the concept and gave a real scenario based upon a pop-up appearing on the screen after navigating to the site.
+I navigated some pseudo code and asked questions to him along the way to ensure he saw the logic I was laying out. He clarified what interval was running when and we sketched out the thread of execution vs the call stack and task queues so he could fully see the intent of the function.
+He asked if he could write down a note within the pseudo code that recorded where his thoughts were at within this part of the functionality. He wanted to confirm he was understanding what was happening in this place of our intended code (which he later turned out to be right in his understanding).
+When we started coding, he clarified that he could write the functions in the traditional non-arrow function format. He stated that he had gotten feedback from previous interview to work on arrow and ternery operator styles for his coding, but he said he just isn't that comfortable and it 'loses its readability'. I complemented him on understanding the tradeoffs of advanced styled code vs readability and explained that best practices would prioritize readability. We then coded out the conditional statement and then pseudo coded it out in a ternery operator just so he got the exposure. He asked some great questions and we visited documentation to re-enforce his understanding, which was already solid.
++++When we finished coding the problem, and he was using excellent technical communication the entire time, he asked if he could generate the tests based upon the examples given and if he could also give an explanation over what we intended their results to be. This was an amazing moment of him showcasing his advanced understanding of the fundamentals, technical communication, and new learning related to the events, duration based functions, callbacks, and the call stack.
+Throughout the coding he was careful with his syntax and mindful of using const and let correctly, even correcting a mistake in a delcaration on his own and then providing me with his on point thought process about the issue.
++We received the correct results and I asked him to re-state why the solution worked, which he was able to do while referencing specific lines of code, even console logging those lines to ensure he was accurate.

Level 4 Challenge B
problem: SubsetSum
Timer: 23 mins

+I drove while he was navigator
+He read prompt aloud and the examples
+he gave his interpretation which included recursion, use of OR operator
+He asked for my input and we talked through the examples again
+He asked if he could give a strategy before starting pseudo code; his strategy, while not optimized was clear in its logic and intent.
+We started pseudo coding and his lead was calm, careful and clear to comopose
+We talked through his stated base cases and he gave me perfect logic for each (he had 3)
+We talked through is recursive call intent and why it should work as expected based upon previous conditional statements and how he was managing his passed in inputs
+He restated the intent of his proposed solution before we dived into coding with excellent technical communication
+I started coding and asked clarifying questions
+I declared default variables but did so using 'let' to see if he would catch issue later -- which he did when we ran into a 'strict mode reserved' error; he quickly looked up the error on his own, though he announced he would like to do so, and came back and asked if we could remove the 'let' keywords and gave an explanation as to what was going on --- it was a near perfect understanding of the strictly typed issue we were experiencing.
+While coding I made a few accidental typos which he promptly but kindly pointed out including two syntax errors that would have casued an issue when we ran the function.
+When I was done coding, I asked him to give an overview of why he thinks this solution would work, and he did so with excellent technical communication with mindfulness of control flow and his recursive call stack.
+He asked about the tests and noticed an edge case of a negative number in one of the given examples. He wanted to use that to ensure everything was still working correctly.
+We received an error (see above) that he tracked down and corrected immediately knowing where to look. We then received the correct results and he stated why the solution was working and offered to console log in between to ensure his logic was on track.

+Timer was up but he asked if the problem was fully optimized and I asked him about time and space complexity familiarity. He acknowledged he should really work on better optimization techniques for time. I pushed him to consider if we needed all the default variables or if there's another way to iterate through the array. He asked how to know when to mutate the original input vs when to not do so. We talked through if slicing off the first element was actually mutating the array or if the input array was still held in memory the same. He understood and gave me a great new approach to the problem. I encouraged him to work on it some more and see if it can be optimized.

+As you can tell, Hao is an advanced learner and someone who he needs to be challenged to push his learning farther. He is kind, patient, calm, funny, and positive.
+very pleasant and fun interview; A very kind human being
+He made comments that he was nervous and we talked through that and it seemed to calm him down
+I asked if he was familiar with PP style and he said he has gone to three in the last week and has another 2 scheduled for tomorrow. He asked if the PP interview was going to be him just typing in silence again or if it could be interactive like he has experienced in non-interview based PP sessions with Codesmith. I explained the latter.
+He was polite, thanked me often and asked about my interests, what I thought of the program, how it compares to other bootcamps; and he stated it was his preferred choice but he has an interview with hackreactor tomorrow and would hope to have feedback ASAP to see if he needs to continue trying with Codesmith in order to be admitted by Sept cohort or if he should choose another bootcamp.
+Genuninely interested in learning more advanced skills. I made some recommendations when we were wrapping up.
