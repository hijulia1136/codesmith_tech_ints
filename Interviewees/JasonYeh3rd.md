# Technical Interview Notes:

\*\*\*Fang did not expect pair programming session but did say he was told that it would be. Yes, he has done a pp session before but didn't think it was possible for interview. Was really thrown by this arrangement, even after I explained how it would work. I offered to do a practice problem with him as the navigator. During and after he was still confused as to the point of the pair programming session and questioned what we were evaluating. I again explained that technical communication is one of the key pieces of criteria that we wanted to consider from him and a PP session is usually a good technique for that evaluation. He was content with this answer but it took a good 15 mins away from interview. As a result, I offered to start on a level he would have already passed by (level 2) so he could better understand the flow.

Level 2 challenge
Problem: countChars
timer: 50 mins
+I was navigator; Fang was driver
-when I asked if we could pseudo code out my logic he didn't do it. I had to ask twice and he said he wasn't familiar with that type of PP session. He stated that he thought I was just telling him how to write the code. I explained the purpose of pseudo code and that it is my habit when PP and even on my own sometimes. He asked if we could just skip to coding, so I did so.
+I gave direction and a few points of clarification but all went smoothly and we got correct answer.

\*\*\*ten min pause to discuss why PP session was necessary (again), what Codesmith was trying to evaluate and if this is what he could expect from the program. I answered all questions again and explained about the curriculum and regular use of PP sessions as well as group work. I underlined the point related to a strong culture and no competitive coding.

Level 3 challenge
Problem: memoryMaker
timer: 30 mins

+Fang was navigator
+read prompt
+closure problem
+high level strategy
+-said he recognized the problem and knew how to solve it; asked if we had to do a PP and I asked if he could give it a try.
+we progressed with PP session
+gave good initial direction
-said he wanted to do an arrow function in one line but couldn't explain what part of the expression was doing what when he communicated it to me; took a while but I got his code right
+got the correct answer

Level 3 Challenge
Problem: sumAllElements
timer:18 mins
+I was navigator he was driving;
-did not want to write my pseudo code despite asking
-understood my strategy and began writing code before I initiated
+he wrote the correct intrepretation of my strategy into code
+got the correct answer
-I corrected him on the way he wrote ++index instead of index + 1 and explain the order of operations but he got upset when he didn't understand it. He asked me to repeat it, which I did in another phrasing. I told him that while our solution, as he wrote it, didn't give the wrong answer it wasn't the correct way to express the incrementing. He didn't like that and said 'he would look further into it'. I offered to send him a resource that could help explain further (see notes for link)

Level 4 challenge
problem: anagrams
timer: 6mins
+read prompt aloud
+asked great clarifying quesitons
+acknowledged he hadn't practice permutation problems yet
+was given a good intrepretation and overall high level strategy
+He navigated while I drove
-started me coding before he finished his logic as a 'rush to get something down'
-when I clarified some direction he gave me he asked if 'he should just do it to show me what he meant' -- he said this kinder than it seems and he wasn't angry; instead he was expressing frustration about pair programming and his inability to properly communicate to me (or my lack of understanding of what he was communicating)

Overall: this session was really a struggle and more than once I stopped and ask if he wanted to continue or try at another time knowing it would be a pair programming interview. At the beginning of the interview he said, (paraphrasing) 'I don't know if you have ever worked with someone who is distracted before but that's just my nature.' There's just something off about Fang, he is pleasant but stern or very serious to the point of awkwardness or stifiling of the conversation. Even making small talk with him was strained. Perhaps it is just nerves. Recommendation: more socialization while coding. I recommend as many pair programming sessions as possible wherein he is with someone of his same caliber of knowledge. He clearly knows JS but the technical falls apart because of his lack of non-technical skills/abilities.
