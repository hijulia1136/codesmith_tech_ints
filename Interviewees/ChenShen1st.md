# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 1 Challenges:
timer: 50:00
Problem: addNumbers

- read the prompt aloud
- wanted to write out the framework of the problem - function
  - no high level strategy or pseudo code

* spoke through for loop but got a little lost and stopped talking

- communicated initialization but not for loop
- communicated test cases
- wrote an edge case test to include negative and asked questions;

Level 2 Challenges:
timer: 45 min
Problem: between50And500
+read prompt aloud
+talked through initial setup of function
+spoke of conditional statement
+asked clarifying questions about exclusive
+wrote tests cases

Level 2 Challenge:
timer: 42 mins
Problem: divBy100
+read prompt aloud
+talked through initial setup of function
+explained conditional statements
+wrote test cases and edge cases
+explained test cases

LEvel 2 Challenge:
timer: 39 mins
Problem: passAllTests
+read prompt aloud
+explained initial setup
+explained use of for loop to iterate through array of functions
+re-read prompt confirming understanding
-did not explain edits
+understood array length
-stopped talking
+used continue
+created own tests
-used previous functions correctly but did not explain why or how she was using them
-received error, read aloud, found syntax error but did not explain
-not talking through errors
-started troubleshooting but did not explain
+tested other cases
+found error of previous functions; troubleshooted by console log within code block with good explanation
-stopped talking when found another error
-stopped talking altogether - thinking but not communicating to me what's going on
+restarted communication by explaining other console logs
-no pseudo code to review; no strategy or logic stated
+re-read prompt
+went back to previous functions to confirm that else if block wasn't being entered
+stated what she was doing but did not explain why or what thought process was
+recognized that she didn't need a condition but didn't explain why
+mindful of syntax and indention
+again stating what she was doing but not why
+found syntax error
+finally went back and psuedo coded to check logic
-recognized what she should do but did not finish pseudo coding and started coding again
+went back and fully psuedo coded entire code block after getting solution correct

Level 3 challenge
timer: 24 mins
problem: add
+read prompt aloud
+restated her understanding of the prompt
+acknowledge a closure problem
+wrote framework first and restated prompt
+wrote tests cases including edge cases
-no pseudo code or strategy
-no talking while coding
-communicated only what she was coding

Level 3 Challenge
timer: 21 mins
problem: item retriever
+read prompt aloud
+acknowledged wanting to go slow to ensure understanding of long written prompt
+started initial setup but paused to re-read prompt
+no pseudo code or high level strategy before coding
-silence while thinking
+clever use of variables inidcates understanding of how to solve problem but no communication of strategy or logic
+-started walking through logic but stopped and got silent
-silent while trouble shooting
+recognized checking object key with console log
+received undefined and stated rationale noticing error
-did not communicate edits or logic behind coding in silence
+good fundamentals use of for of loop for objects
-checked for errors along the way but did so in silence
-stopped talking while troubleshooting
+decided to change to a traditional for loop but did not explain why
+re-read prompt to ensure she understood return value required
-silent editing
+understanding of object key-value syntax
+figured out solution but did not communicate during edits and did not explain solution or code block
+recognized optimizing code and went through and eliminated unnecessary code - DRY prinicple
+confirmed all results as expected

Level 4 Challenge
timer: 9 mins
problem: transpose
+read prompt aloud
+communicated her intrepretation of prompt with some high level strategy
+-pseudo coded assumptions but did not ask
+communicated code but not why; no logic
+recognized 2 for loops to go through each item but did not explain why
-no communication; silence while coding for loops
-long pause without communication
+wrote test cases
+Received error and noticed syntax issues but in silence
+received another error and did console log to confirm for loop
+talking aloud code and why error was occuring
+found typo and resolved issue but discovered order was off
+reviewed code aloud
-silence during troubleshooting
+recognized problem aloud but did not explain why
+received another error but met with silience
+spoke solution aloud
