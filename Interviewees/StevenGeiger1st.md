# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 1 Challenge
Problem A: declare variable and addNumbers
Timer: 55 mins

+read prompt aloud; said he couldn't really write pseudo code
+confirmed his code witwh console.log
+understood let vs const

+read prompt aloud
+pseudo cocde with good techncial communication and initial setup of function
+talked through strategy of which loop for or while loop; pseudo code
+announced he was going to start coding
+solid technical communication while coding
+while loop with counter with correct conditional
+excellent communication within while loop explaining the strategy with each iteration
+created own tests; understood invocation of function
+received correct result but wasn't sure sum was correct so added in console log to see sum progress -- moved very confidently through this understanding of how the function was working

Level 2 Challenge
Problem A: ...passAllTests
Timer: 48 mins

+read prompt aloud
+starting pseudo code
+announced he wanted to think how he wanted to write conditional; technical communication after pause was great with good logic and understanding of problem and desired outcome
+announced he was going to start coding
+well organized with pseudo code in his code block
+excellent technical communication throughout coding
+created own tests and gave explanation of why it returned the right results

+read prompt aloud
+announced pseudo coding
+announced he wanted to use modulo operator as part of his strategy; demonstrated good logic and a good approach to the problem; gave explanation of modulo operator and its use in this solution
+I can tell he is feeling more confident and comfortable; he voice isn't wavering and he is coding more fluidily
+well organized with pseudo code in his code block
+announced coding with excellent technical communication throughout
+excellent explanation and understanding of his conditional statements
+created own tests with correct results

+read prompt aloud
+announced pseudo coding with excellent strategy and technical communication
+announced start of coding
+well organized with pseudo code in his code block
+excellent explanation of his conditional check use of OR and modulo operators
+created own tests with correct results

+read prompt aloud
++seems very nervous reading aloud - voice wavering again
+announced pseudo code with high level strategy and good logic for intended solution
+excellent logic related to his iteration invoking the current function
+excellent logic and technical communication for his conditional statement to check boolean value returned
+recognized he needs to declare a boolean variable to return as his result -- understood if the result of invocation is ever false he will re-assign his variable; nice logic and excellent explanation of short circuiting loop to return result immediately; good optimization
+reviewed his intended strategy and gave overall approach again
+announced start of coding with excellent technical communication
+well organized with pseudo code in his code block
+assigned boolean variable default of true with excellent logic behind changing to false as a result of his loop
+good logic and technical communication of loop;
+use of one line if statement with use of 'break'
+excellent review of loop and conditional logic to confirm his code to include what happens if it never returns false
+caught a missing bracket syntax error while reviewing his code
+understood commenting back in previous functions in order to run tests
+created own tests -- array of functions; good explanation of why this was necessary and clarified that this array just holds the function definitions not the invocation of these functions
+before running tests reviewed code with tests with excellent technical communication with strategy
+syntax error but caught it right away
+correct results
+gave logic and explanation behind solution

Level 2 challenge
Problem: C palindrome
timer: 27 mins

+read prompt aloud
+announced he wanted to just think; quickly came back and announced the use of reverse method/P++Higher Order functions
+announced pseudo code; asked if he could clarify reverse method and wants to confirm it can work on string into an array; states that it will mutate array
+asks to think again and pauses; and provides general approach
+back to pseudo code with correction of use of string instead of array using split the string into an array and then use of reverse method and then join back into string; and then compare these two strings -- missing how he will iterate and compare
+announced ready to code with initial setup of function
+well organized with pseudo code in his code block
++understands chaining methods with correct syntax
++wants to use ternery operator; implements correctly
+writes own test cases
+reviews code with strategy and excellent technical communication of code before running tests
+correct results received

Level 3 Challenge
Problem: B getLength
Timer: 18mins

+read prompt
+understood that if he can't use methods or length he thinks it is a recursive problem; gave high level strategy related to his base case +++ excellent communication
+announced pseudo code with excellent logic and strategy
+excellent explanation to avoid stack overflow with an infinite loop
+excellent technical communication of base/break case and the logic behind it
+understands accessing the string as if it were an array; string[index]
+excellent technical communication of recursive call and tracking index during call
+excellent knowledge of not creating index within the function will create a default parameter
+announced coding with initial setup
+well organized with pseudo code in his code block
+excellent explanation of code with strategy
+excellent technical communication through base case
+excellent technical communication with recursive call
+understood tail call recursion
+created own tests and provided strategy of code before running tests
+correct results

Level 3 Challenge
Problem C itemRetriever
Timer: 12 mins

+read prompt
+re-reads prompt and then states his high level strategy using higher order functions
+believes the problem is closure with excellent explanation
+wants to think through his overall strategy; comes back quickly with excellent explanation and logic for his approach
+announces potential use of helper function
+wants to start pseudo coding to keep track of his thoughts
+very calm as he wrote his pseudo code
+not certain of the type of variable he wants to use to store in 'closed over variable environment' to keep track of author
+excellent logic and technical communication of logic for inner function; slight pause and reviews previous psuedo code
+excellent pseudo code regarding incrementation of closure variable but says he still isn't certain how he wants to implement the variable
+says he wants to start coding to see what changes he wants to make but wants to start with this initial pseudo code
+setup of initial function
+pauses and states that he wants to think through how he wants to iterate through object with the key
+comes back quickly from pause and announces use of object.keys as a potential tracking mechanism; but quickly recognizes he doesn't have to do that because of what the prompt says
+thinks he wants to create counter starting at zero as his variable to track movement through object
+use of anonymous function returning next author
+amazing potential solution!!!
+he is getting excited as he announces that he sees a path forward!
+excellent technical communication and continuation of psuedo code from where he left off
+excellent explanation of use of key-value pairs within function use of bracket notation
+use of console log within inner function to log next author while incrementing counter
+implicit return -- understanding
+creates own tests with his explanation that compares counter to key but -hasn't completed entire functionality where he compares counter to key
+immediately sees that he hasn't completed the function
+results include undefined between authors; acknowledges results but wants to console log within the function to see what's happening where
+receives indication that it is because he has console logs
+re

++super friendly; acknowledged he was nervous
+very clear communication; easy to read pseudo and code
