# Technical Interview Notes:

Level 4 Challenge
Problem: A anagrams
Timer: 55 mins

+She navigated
+read prompt aloud; she commented that the problem seems like a recursion or nested recursion
+she asked me about her strategy which was to use two for loops and doesn't see away around that expensive process; her strategy was to loop and swap or switch the letters; after getting that far she wanted to see what was next but admitted that she couldn't see how that could work effectively so she asked for my thoughts and then asked if we could just pseudo and then code out that far before contemplating anything further. She said for problems like these it is helpful for her to get the initial code block working before moving onto compounding steps.
+we worked through the scenarios of the for loops and when to call her swap function, which changed direction twice but was a collaborative process with her asking for my input and ideas and appreciating the feedback and taking it into consideration and use.
+she gave navigation/instruction calmly and appreciated my clarifying questions and input. Her technical communication was clear and easy to understand.
+when we were pseudo coding examples, she got a little lost in her thoughts but continued to ask if she was making sense, and when we worked through two loops together she became more clear in her intent and instruction. She liked a suggestion I made from the solution to change the string into an array and that seemed to give her a great pathway forward. She complimented me on a great idea and she incorporated it into her solution.
+we got to testing the loops and the swap function but it wasn't quite working how she intended
+throughout the pseudocoding she kept saying she was having a hard time seeing how to make this solution worked but thought that we had come up with a good initial starting place
+she was very kind, patient and calm, moving confidentlyl to explain her logic and thought process to me. She answered all my questions effectively and never once show signs of frustration. She asked for my input when she would pause, or she would confirm her thinking with me.
+While I was pseudocoding if I misunderstood her intended logic, she would politely and apologetically ask if we could go back and revise that part to ensure we were both on the same page.
+In the course of creating a visual to where each of the for loops were at a given position/iteration we both went back and forth pseudocoding to ensure we were tracking the other's thinking. She really appreciated this time to visualize the loops and positions of her index in order to understand where to put her swap function.
+time expired as we were trying to re-configure the swap function but she had a good intended solution and was likely to solve it.
+While she is soft spoken, this could easily be misunderstood for being quiet when she should be talking. She maintained her communication at all times, even when she asked to think it through she was thinking aloud.
+I think more pp sessions are good for her but I have full confidence in her ability to work with someone and through blocks in a polite, collaborative and learning environment.

+Came online very appreciative to the Codesmith admin team and me for adjusting to meet her needs for this interview.
+asked questions to understand how a PP session could be an interview -- I explained that it was a collaborative session and she should try not to think of it as an interview and I would take notes after the session ended. This seemed to make her less nervous.
