# CodeSmith Technical Interview Questions

## Instructions

1. Read the below prompt to the applicant before starting the interview:

> - _"I will paste an endless series of increasingly difficult challenges into the editor. Your task is to figure them out as best as you can, and remember that we're looking for qualities beyond how many questions you get through, such as technical communication and engineering best practices.
>   Feel free to use any online resources that you normally would, e.g. Google, Stack Overflow, documentation pages. Just don't look up the solution directly. And when you do look something up, let me know what you are looking up so I can understand your thought process. There are no penalties for looking things up.
>   There are also no penalties for errors, so don't be afraid to run your code with an expected outcome and use any error messages to your advantage in refactoring to get the desired outcome.
>   Remember the importance of testing your code as some of the problems will build on each other, so you want to make sure it works before moving on.
>   Lastly, be sure to verbalize your thought process, as your technical communication is something we're looking for. As you're thinking through it, be sure to keep me updated on your overall strategy. This will help me to assess how you might work in a pair programming session or group environment.
>   I'm not able to give any technical feedback today, but you will receive feedback and the result of your interview directly from an Admissions Team Member within one week. Do you have any questions now regarding the format of the interview?"_

- If you are conducting an online interview, also read this to the interviewee:
  > - _"I will be having you share your screen with me through the duration of the interview, so please close out of all unnecessary screens and turn off any distracting notifications"_

2. Conduct technical interview (60 mins) - Set up csbin: - Open up `csbin.io/interview/(interviewee's name)` - Have interviewee go to the same URL. This will allow both of you to see what the other is typing. - There are template md files for each interview to help you keep track of challenge prompts and notes. - Choose the directory of interview questions that are appropriate for the applicant's interview (1st, 2nd, or 3rd interview). - Questions that are given to interviewees should be chosen at random. - The break down of questions given to interviewees should be as follows: - 1 level 1 question - 2 level 2 questions - 2 level 3 questions - 2 level 4 questions

   - **NOTE:** some problems have multiple steps _(Each of these steps are outlined in the template files)_ that build on each other, so be sure to only paste in one step at a time.
   - As applicant is solving problems use the interview template to take notes under the _"NOTES:"_ section of each problem.
     > #### Note: There are solutions for each problem in this repo. These are simply common solutions to these challenges and are not necessarily indicative of the best solutions possible.

## How challenges test applicants:

- Level 1 questions: Level 1 questions are the easiest level of questions. These questions should center around the more fundamental pieces of JavaScript (declaring variables, different data types, and loops)

- Level 2 questions: Level 2 questions are the slightly more advanced than level 1 questions. These questions should center around easier JSHPs concepts like Higher Order Functions

- Level 3 questions: Level 3 questions are the slightly more advanced than level 2 questions. These questions should center around more complex JSHPs concepts like Closure and recursion.

- Level 4 questions: Level 4 questions are reserved for those applicants that are not being challenged by any of the other challenges. These questions should center around tougher algorithms and time complexity.
